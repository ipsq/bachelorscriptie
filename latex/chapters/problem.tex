In this paper, I would like to pose the following main research question:
\textbf{Comparing various small data- and big data-models for forecasting interest rates}. To answer this main research question, I will be making use of the following sub questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item What constitutes a small data- and a big data-model?
	\item What methods are useful for comparing two different model forecasts?
	\item Is there accuracy to be gained by including macroeconomic variables?
	\item Do Diffusion Indexes estimated from large datasets improve forecasts?
	\item Does applying SPCA, instead of regular PCA, result in a better forecast?
\end{itemize}
