\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Dimension reduction}
Given that our big data models make use of very large data sets containing redundant data and irrelevant information, we can make use of various dimension reduction techniques.

\subsubsection{Autoregressive (AR) and Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Models}
These models are formulated as follows
\[
y_{t+h}(\tau) = c + \beta' W_t + \epsilon_{t+h}
\]
where $\tau$ denotes the maturity and $y_{t+h}(\tau)$ measures the annual yield of the bond. For the autoregressive model, $W_t$ contains lags of $y_{t+h}(\tau)$. For the vector autoregressive model, $W_t$ additionally contains explanatory variables.
