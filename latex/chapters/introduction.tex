With the rise of big data in the past 20 years, there have been numerous analysis techniques developed to make use of these large datasets. 
In this paper, we compare the forecasting ability of various small and big-data models developed over the past century. 
We will apply these models for forecasting interest rates. 
We will use a large set of monthly macroeconomic indicators for our the construction of our diffusion indexes. 
This research has various practical applications, not only for interest rate modeling, but for time series forecasting modeling in general. 
Some models and techniques shown in this research are specifically geared towards interest rate modeling whilst others can be applied on an entirely different problem set, also outside of economics.
